            is our legitimate interests, such as monitoring and improving the

        <h3>Blockchain Data</h3>

        <p>
          Please note that we are not responsible for (i) your use of Ethereum
          or any other blockchain and (ii) the use of your personal data as
          processed in these decentralized and permissionless blockchain

          your own device.
        </p>

        <p>
          You should also be aware that due to the inherent transparency of the
          blockchain networks, transactions that you approve when using the
          Interface may be publicly accessible. This includes, but is not
          limited to, your public sending address, the public address of the
          receiver, the amount sent or received, and any other data a user has
          chosen to include in a given transaction. Transactions and addresses
          available on blockchain may reveal personal data about the
          user&rsquo;s identity, and personal data can potentially be correlated
          now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law
          enforcement. In addition, we may process publicly available data,
          including information obtained through blockchain intelligence and
          analytics services. This may involve analyzing blockchain
          transactions, wallet addresses, and other data accessible on public
          blockchains or related platforms to enhance the functionality of the
          Services, ensure security, and provide insights into blockchain
          activities. Certain elements, when combined with other information,
          may reveal your identity.
        </p>

        <p>
          We encourage you to review how privacy and transparency on the
          blockchain network works.

        </p>

        <p>
          We use Google Analytics on our Platform. These are services provided

          customers based in the EU, for more information visit
          https://policies.google.com/?hl=en) and allow us to measure and
          evaluate the use of our Platform (without identifying individuals).
          Permanent cookies, which are placed by the service provider, are also
          used for this purpose. Although such service providers do not receive
          personal data from us (and do not retain any IP addresses), they may
          track your use of the Platform, combine this information with data
          from other websites you have visited, which are also tracked by
          service providers, and use this information for their own purposes
          (e.g. to manage to advertise). If you have registered with the service
          provider concerned, the service provider will also know your identity.
          The service provider concerned will then be responsible for processing
          your personal data by the applicable data protection provisions.
          Service providers only provide information on how a particular website
          is used (but not any personal details).
        </p>

        <p>
          We also use plugins from social networks such as Facebook, Twitter,
          YouTube, Google+, and LinkedIn on our Platform. This will be evident
          to you, as the relevant symbol will typically be displayed. We have
          configured these elements to be disabled by default. If you enable
          these (by clicking on them), the social network operators may register
          that you are on our website and where you are on our website and may
          use this information for their purposes. The operator concerned will
          then be responsible for processing your personal data by the
          applicable data protection provisions. We will not receive any
          information regarding you from the operator concerned.

          regulatory and contractual obligations to which we are subject. Once
          this retention period is over, we delete the personal data or

        <h2>9. Third-Country Transfers</h2>

        <p>
          Please note that we process personal data and hire service providers
          located in countries outside the EU/EEA. These third countries may not
          offer a level of data protection equivalent to that of the EU/EEA.
        </p>

        <p>
          To ensure the security of your personal data during these transfers,
          we fulfill applicable legal obligations by adopting appropriate
          safeguards. These safeguards include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Transfer of data to countries that have received an adequacy
            decision from the European Commission.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implementation of standard contractual clauses provided by the
            European Commission, in accordance with{" "}
            <a
              href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >
              Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021
            </a>
            , as well as supplementary measures for the transfer, where we
            consider that such measures are necessary to guarantee a level of
            protection essentially equivalent to that of the EU.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In the event of a transfer to a third country where adequacy decisions
          or appropriate safeguards are absent, it is conceivable that
          authorities in the third country, such as intelligence services, could
          access the transferred data. Consequently, the enforceability of your
          data subject rights may not be guaranteed.
        </p>

        <p>
          We and/or our service providers transfer your personal data to and
          process it in countries outside the EU/EEA. These countries include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>United States of America;</li>
          <li>United Kingdom.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In cases where the transfer to a third country is based on the use of
          standard contractual clauses provided by the European Commission, you
          have the right to request a copy of the clauses under which your
          personal data is transferred to a third country. However, the contract
          may be redacted in those parts that must remain confidential (i.e.
          other people&#39;s personal data). You can request the applicable
          copies by contacting:{" "}

        <h2>10. Data Disclosure</h2>

          We may disclose your personal data when we have a sincere belief that
          such disclosure is essential for the following purposes:

        <ul>
          <li>
            To fulfil a legal obligation, which includes cases where such
            disclosure is required by law or in response to lawful requests from
            public authorities, such as a court or a government agency.
          </li>
          <li>
            To safeguard the security of our services and safeguard our rights
            or property.
          </li>
          <li>
            To prevent or investigate potential unlawful conduct related to our
            operations.

        <h2>11. How we keep personal data safe</h2>

        <p>
          We implement reasonable technical and organizational security measures
          that we consider appropriate to safeguard your stored personal data
          from manipulation, loss, or unauthorized access by third parties. Our
          security measures are continuously updated to align with advancements
          in technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          We place significant emphasis on internal data privacy. Our staff and
          engaged service providers are bound by confidentiality and must comply

          to personal data only to the extent necessary for the performance of
          their respective duties or obligations.
        </p>

        <p>
          We value the security of your personal data; however, please bear in
          mind that no method of transmitting data over the internet or
          electronic storage can be guaranteed 100% secure. While we make every
          effort to employ commercially reasonable measures to protect your
          personal data, we cannot provide absolute security. We recommend
          employing antivirus software, firewalls, and similar tools to enhance
          the protection of your system.
