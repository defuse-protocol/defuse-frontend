# Terminal Commands
- Always prefix terminal commands with `nix develop --command` to ensure access to Nix/direnv environment tools like bun
- Example: `nix develop --command bun install` instead of just `bun install`

# Linting Workflow
- Before making manual lint fixes in any file, first run the corresponding lint --fix command
- Example: `nix develop --command bun run lint --fix filename`
- Only fix remaining issues manually after running the automated fix command

# Development Environment
- This project uses Nix flakes with direnv for dependency management
- Tools like bun are available through the Nix environment, not system-wide
- Always use the nix develop prefix to access these tools
- When asking user to run a command, don't use the nix develop prefix
