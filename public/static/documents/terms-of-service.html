        desired outcome of a transaction or series of transactions without
        prescribing the method of execution. An Intent may include parameters

        translates such Intent into one or more executable on-chain

        actions, and for submitting the resulting transaction(s) for settlement
        on the applicable blockchain. Solvers may operate autonomously or under

        experience development and improvement, including those for the
        informational, security, and entertainment purposes, which are not
        intended to affect the main purpose of the Interface described above. We
        only provide you with access to the relevant interface and software and

        with the Protocol by providing web or mobile-based access. Through the
        Interfaces, users can declare desired outcomes (Intents) on various
        public blockchains, including but not limited to NEAR, Bitcoin,
        Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana. These Intents are broadcasted to the
        Solver Network that independently analyze and compete to execute the

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c0"
        >The Interfaces revolve around the concept of &quot;intents,&quot; which
        are structured declarations containing key details such as the
        initiator&#39;s NEAR account ID, the type of intent (e.g., token swap,
        transfer), source assets and amounts, desired outcomes, unique
        identifiers for tracking, and optional constraints like deadlines or
        minimum outputs. These intents are broadcasted to a Solver Network,
        where Solvers analyze and compete to provide an execution plan. Once a
        user approves a Solver&#39;s quote, the Intent is executed via a smart
        contract on NEAR (intents.near) (being the Protocol), which handles the
        transaction - including cross-chain operations if necessary - while
        ensuring state changes are verified and reported back to the originator.
        This abstraction streamlines complex blockchain processes into an
        intuitive and efficient user experience.</span

        using the Interfaces, you understand that you are not buying or selling
        digital assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on
        the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. When users pay
        fees for trades, and/or any Slippage, those fees may accrue to Solvers,
        Liquidity Providers and Relayers for the Protocol. As a general matter,
        Solvers, Liquidity providers and Relayers are independent third parties.
